                Concept
            </h2>
            <p>
                MasterMind is a 2-teamed puzzle game, initially a board game, where one team makes 
                a four-color secret code and the other team has to try to figure out that code 
                with hints given by the opponent. In many digital cases, the code team is the 
                computer, and the solving team is the user.

                Platform
            </h2>
            <p>
                This game is currently only desktop compatable.
            </p>

        <div id="theme">

                Theme
            </h2>
            <p>
                this game doesn't have a story per se, but it does have a general theme for this 
                version of the game, which is sort of man vs machine. Can the player figure out 
                the secret code before they run out of turns? 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="style">
            <h2>
                Style
            </h2>
            <p>
                The style will be kind of futuristic. The game board will look like a sort of 
                circuit board, with LEDs lighting up based on player selections and hints. sound 
                design would be stereotypical machine noises -- that is: beeps, whistles, etc.

        <div id="gameplay">
            <h2>
                Gameplay

            <h3>
                Mechanics
            </h3>

            <p>
                The player can place any of the six available colors anywhere within the current 
                row at any time. The computer will then give the player hints as to how many 
                pieces the player got right. Hints given to help the player will not be able to 
                stop them from making illogical decisions, that is up to the player to figure out.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Control
            </h3>
            <p>
                Current plans have controls being done solely with the mouse.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Teaching the Player
            </h3>
            <p>
                The rules for the game are fairly simple, so there will be a small onscreen HUD 
                with the rules, and otherwise the player must figure out the nuance of the game 
                by themselves.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Player Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
                As the user plays multiple games, they will develop their own strategies as to 
                solving the puzzles with minimum turn usage. For example, using colors multiple 
                times in the same guess help eliminate outside variables on the specific theory 
                they would be currently testing. This strategy comes with experience, but will not 
                be taught in any way.
