            Largely outlined the game as it stands. Got most of the framework of the different classes and their interraction, but game logic 
            partially or entirely missing in some places. Will need to go back eventually and update visuals. Right now everything is a circle, 
            but there will eventually be real art we make for our menus and game interface.

            Went back to fix bugs, get things more compacted. The logic inserted managed to shift the visuals and make the game hard to play, 
            but we have at least something to show in class tomorrow.

            Found the main error and have a fully functioning game with logic -- most of the remaining changes will be visual upgrades to the 
            interface itself

            Final version of the game due tomorrow. All of the art has been created but menus still need to be updated with that art. The game 
            interface has been drastically updated to a more visually appealing and sytlistically consistent layout.
